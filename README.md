This calculator is a basic web-based calculator that allows you to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It has a simple user interface where you can input numerical values and perform calculations. The calculator also includes additional functionalities such as clearing the display (`AC` button), deleting the last entered digit (`DEL` button), adding a decimal point (`.` button), and calculating percentages (`%` button). 
You can perform calculations by clicking the respective buttons or by using your keyboard. The result of the calculation is displayed in real-time on the input field. It provides a convenient way to perform simple mathematical calculations within a web browser.
